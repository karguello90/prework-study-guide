# <Prework Study Guide>

## Refering back to this data through my coding journey

This study guide was created through steady participation of the UCF Coding BootCamp prework assignment. The objective of this study guide is to have a point of reference when needed throughout the course.

- The goal of this studyguide is to build a solid foundation of notes and references.
- This project was built to acquire as much knowledge as possible using the resources provided.
- The study guide will provide clarity and reminders during moments of practicing code.
- Through practice, several key elements were learned - Algorythms, computational thinking, Git and Git processes, HTML, CSS, and JS.
